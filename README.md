## LAUNCH ACADEMY final project

Quick-Bytes is an application that allows users to search food recipes from the Edamam API. Ruby on rails front-end MVC framework provided structured routes and views to display user created recipe lists and allowed easy navigation through rails links. The back-end is supported with PostgreSQL to provide database relations and form functionality. Rails params was used to store information returned from the Edamam API so users can create recipe lists with a touch of a button.

Ingredients and cooking directions are at your fingertips to ease the process of making your next home made meal.
